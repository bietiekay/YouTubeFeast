YouTubeFeast - a semi-automatic YouTube video downloading tool

For several years now I've subscribed YouTube channels and I keep adding subscriptions
over the years. For about one year now I am using ByTubeD - a firefox add-on - to 
download new videos that appear in my subscribed YouTube channels.

Now sadly this is a completly manual process. I have to go to the channel homepage, I
have to select what I want to download and sometimes I need to look after the download
process because when it's taking too long (like when I initially download a whole 400
video batch of a new channel I've subscribed...) the video URLs time-out and are not
useable anymore.

Now the solution is to write a small programm which automatically downloads once every
while all the new videos in configured YouTube channels.
